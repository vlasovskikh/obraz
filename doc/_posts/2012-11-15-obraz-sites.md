title: Obraz Sites
---

Since the last 0.2.1 release several people have started to use Obraz for their
sites. The only site with open sources that I'm aware of is [Labs.dendiz.com][1]
([sources][2]). Here is [a blog post][3] with some details on using Obraz for
this site.

I keep a list of sites using Obraz. If you run your site on Obraz and you want
to put a link to it on the Obraz homepage, feel free to send me an email or open
a pull request on [Bitbucket][4].
