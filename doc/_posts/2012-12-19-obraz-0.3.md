In this release the command line arguments have been changed to be more
informative for new users. The help message is shown by default.

Also the plugin interface has been extended in order to provide an extension
point for adding custom Jinja2 filters. The plugin system added in
[Obraz 0.2][1] is still considered experimental.

What's new:

* Site path as a required command line argument
* `obraz.template_filters` extension point for adding custom Jinja2
  templates
* `markdownify` template filter as in Jekyll
* `obraz.filters` extension point renamed to `obraz.file_filters`
