Obraz is now [mostly compatible][1] with Jekyll 1.4. It is still a single file
with a few dependencies and it's less than 800 lines of very readable Python
code, almost 5 times smaller than Jekyll.

Major features of this release are:

* New `serve` command with a file watcher
* Command line options compatible with Jekyll
* New documented [plugin system][2]
* Extension point for changing the template system
