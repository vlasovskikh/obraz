Obraz is now mostly compatible with Jekyll. It is still a single file with a
few dependencies and it's less than 700 lines of very readable Pyhton code,
almost 5 times smaller than Jekyll.

Major features of this release are:

* New `serve` command with a file watcher
* Command line options compatible with Jekyll
* New documented [plugin system][2]
* Extension point for changing the template system
