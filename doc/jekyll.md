{{ page.title }}
================

Obraz is mostly compatible with Jekyll 1.4. Since most parts of the [Jekyll
documentation][1] are valid for Obraz too, Obraz doesn't have its own
documentation.

However, there are several differences you should be aware of.


Different
---------

* Template system

    Jekyll uses the Liquid templates system written in Ruby, but Obraz is
    written in Python and it cannot use Liquid. Obraz uses the Jinja2 templates
    system by default. Note, that you can change the template system via
    [plugins][5].

    Jinja2 tag syntax is very similar to Liquid, but its set of filters is
    quite different. The process of translation a Liquid template to Jinja2 is
    usually straightforward. See the [Jinja2 templates documentation][2] for
    details.

    Jekyll filters in Obraz: `markdownify`.

* Plugin system

    Obraz has its own [plugin system][5] incompatible with Jekyll.

* Permalink syntax

    Permalinks are specified using Python curly braces string formatting. For
    example:

        /foo/bar/{year}/{month}/{day}/{title}.html

    Variables `i_month` and `i_day`, as well as built-in permalink styles, are
    not available.

* Help command

    Use `--help` flag instead of `help` command.

* Verbosity level

    Obraz is verbose by default, there is no `--verbose` flag. Use `--quiet`
    flag to decrease verbosity.

* Raw content of pages

    Use `raw_content` template data variable on pages in order to disable
    content rendering via the template system. In Jekyll you have to wrap your
    content that could clash with template formatting into
    {% raw %}`{% raw %}`{% endraw %} template tags.


Not Implemented Yet
-------------------

* Some commands

    The following commands are not supported: `docs`, `doctor`.

* Textile markup

    Textile markup language is not supported. Note, that you can register
    custom markup filters via [plugins][5].

* Some template data variables

    The following template data variables are not supported: `paginator`,
    `site.related_posts`, `site.categories`,  `page.excerpt`,
    `page.categories`, `site.data`.

* Some command-line flags

    The following command-line flags are not supported: `--future`,
    `--lsi`, `--limit_posts`, `--detach`, `--plugins`, `--layouts`, `--config`.

* Some config options

    The following `_config.yml` options are not supported: `timezone`, `future`,
    `lsi`, `limit_posts`, `encoding`.


Not in Obraz
------------

* Syntax highlighting

    No syntax highlighting is built into Obraz. You can use a cool
    [highlight.js][3] library to highlight your code using only _two_ lines of
    JavaScript code.

* Blog migration tools and `import` command

    Obraz doesn't contain any blog migration tools. Use the tools from Jekyll in
    order to migrate from popular blog hosting sites to Obraz.
