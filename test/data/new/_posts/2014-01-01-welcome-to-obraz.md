title: Welcome to Obraz!
---

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory â€” edit this post and re-build
(or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes! To add new posts, simply add
a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention:
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Obraz also offers powerful support for code snippets via highlight.js:

    def print_hi(name):
        print('Hi, {}'.format(name))

    # Prints 'Hi, Andrey' to sys.stdout
    print_hi('Andrey')

Check out the [Obraz docs][obraz] for more info on how to get the most out of
Obraz. File all bugs/feature requests at [Obraz's Bitbucket repo][obraz-bb].
